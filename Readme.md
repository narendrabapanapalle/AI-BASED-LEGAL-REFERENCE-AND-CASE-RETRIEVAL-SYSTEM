#  AI Legal Reference and Case Retrieval System

##  Overview
**AI Legal Reference and Case Retrieval System** is an intelligent **AI-powered legal research assistant** designed to provide legal professionals with a **conversational interface for case research and document retrieval**. The platform enables users to **query legal documents, case laws, and constitutional articles using natural language**, delivering accurate and contextually relevant legal information instantly.

Developed during my **internship at Infosys (August 2025 - October 2025)** using **Python, Streamlit, LangChain, and OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo** for the **frontend and AI processing**, along with **Sentence-Transformers and Pinecone vector database** for **semantic search**, and **SQLite for secure backend management**, this system ensures **precision, efficiency, and reliable legal research support**.

##  Internship Highlights
**Company:** Infosys  
**Role:** Artificial Intelligence Intern  
**Duration:** August 2025 - October 2025  
**Mode:** Remote

### Key Achievements:
 Developed a **full-stack AI Legal Reference and Case Retrieval System** from scratch  
 Engineered a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** integrating LangChain with OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo  
 Implemented **efficient semantic search functionality** using Sentence-Transformers and Pinecone vector database  
 Designed a **secure SQLite-based backend** for user authentication and persistent chat histories  
 Created an **intuitive conversational interface** for legal professionals to conduct research efficiently  
 Successfully delivered **context-aware answers** to complex legal queries with proper citations

---

##  Future Plans
 Integrate **Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other legal statutes** for comprehensive coverage.

##  How It Works
1. **User Authentication:** Legal professionals register and log in securely
2. **Document Processing:** Legal documents are preprocessed and converted into vector embeddings
3. **Vector Storage:** Embeddings are stored in Pinecone vector database for efficient retrieval
4. **Query Input:** Users ask legal questions in natural language through the chat interface
5. **Semantic Search:** System searches for relevant legal information using Sentence-Transformers
6. **RAG Pipeline:** Retrieved documents are passed to GPT-3.5-Turbo for generating contextual answers
